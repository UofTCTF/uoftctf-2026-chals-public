  All this obfuscation has left Han Shangyan seeing double. Even Grunt refuses to untangle this mess for him, so it's up to you to do the real _grunt_ work (hahaha get it???). 

  Hint: This challenge can be solved without fully deobfuscating the script, but writing a deobfuscator might help you with the "ML Connoisseur" challenge...
