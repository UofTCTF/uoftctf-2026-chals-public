Quick solve path: 

1. Look up Pokemon prototypes fake or some combination, you will get this thread as the top result (and a shit ton of articles about it) https://www.elitefourum.com/t/many-of-the-pokemon-playtest-cards-were-likely-printed-in-2024/

2. Read the reports and look in the thread on how my friend decoded it

3. Convert the image to CMYK in a photo editor (Krita if no money, Photoshop if money or sail the seas)

4. Isolate the yellow channel, fudge with the contrast to see the dots

5. Either read the paper on how to decode by hand (fun way) or decode it semi-manually using a tool from the thread (lame way)

6. I could have added a lot more OSINT to this but figured against it as it's mostly a forensics challenge
