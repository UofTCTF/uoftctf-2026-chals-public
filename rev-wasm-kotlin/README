TLDR password checker using exceptions, gc, reference types, and other newer wasm features (that generaly decompilers dont support)

Compile :
```
./compile.sh
```
Doesn't output immediately, so it might say "executable not found" thats fine.

Check runtime:
```
./check-logic.sh
```

Minimize:
```
./minimize.sh
```

Test & running
```
node dist/run.mjs
```
