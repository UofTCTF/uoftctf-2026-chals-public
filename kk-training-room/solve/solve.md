The **K&K Check-In Bot** is a **public Discord bot**, meaning anyone can invite it to their own server. By enabling Developer Mode, copying the bot’s **user ID**, and using a standard [OAuth2 invite URL](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html), we can add the bot to a server we control and give it administrator permissions. This is significant because it lets us freely create channels and webhooks that the bot can interact with.

The first vulnerability is **username-based authorization**. The bot checks `message.author.username === "admin"` to restrict webhook creation. Discord usernames are not unique and bots/webhook messages can set **arbitrary usernames**, so we can create a bot or webhook and send `!webhook` while impersonating `"admin"`, bypassing the check.

The second vulnerability is **unauthenticated interaction handling**. Because of a [newer](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook) Discord API feature, **application-created** webhooks are allowed to send messages with interactive components (such as buttons). Any interaction triggered from those components is trusted by the bot without additional verification. Since the bot does not validate the interaction source, any `customId` can be forged using the application owned webhook, including `customId = "checkin"`, causing the bot to assign the K&K role.
