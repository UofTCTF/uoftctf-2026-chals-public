  I really like Go Go Squid! In fact, I like it so much that I even bought the same model of cabinet
  that is in the series!

  Can you find:

  1. The first and last name of the designer of this cabinet?

  2. The episode and timestamp that this cabinet first appears at all in the series on YouTube?

  Flag format: uoftctf{First_Last_EpisodeNum_MM:SS}

  Example: uoftctf{John_Doe_06_07:27}
  
  Notes:
  
  1. Mind the flag format/example :)
  
  2. There is a 1-second fowards leniency in the timestamp (if 1:00 is correct, then 1:01 is correct)
