  Han Shangyan was tired of Team K&K getting skill-diffed every time they were faced with client-side web challenges. After some self-reflection, he finally accepted that training his squad solely with aim trainers _might_ not be the best approach. Instead, he decided to make a _totally realistic_ CTF challenge for his team to practice on.

  Submit flag 1 here. Both challenges use the same attachment.

  Note: Port 5001 is not exposed on the remote instance. However, the bot can still access it and this does not interfere with the intended solution.
