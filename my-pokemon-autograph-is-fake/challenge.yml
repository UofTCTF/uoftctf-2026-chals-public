  Han Shangyan wanted to buy an autographed Pokemon card for Tong Nian. Unfortunately, he
  found out that it was fake! He wants to find out more about this forger, but they have
  deleted the auction! Can you help him put a stop to this 2-year-long scheme?

  https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/t1101312767
 
  What you will need to find:

  1. The link to the forger's Yahoo Japan Auctions profile

  2. The link to the forger's Mercari profile, where they still sell similar forgeries to this
  day

  3. One of the seller's forgeries of the same Pokemon artist as the forgery in the link given was
  graded and authenticated with PSA (most trustworthy grading service btw)! Find how much yen it sold
  for originally.

  4. The first and last name of the Pokemon artist of the first autograph in the PSA submission that
  the forger submitted that contains the card from (3).

  5. Finally, the forger copied the card from (3) from a real signing event to make it look
  real. What Pokemon artist was first to autograph in that event? Get their twitter username.

  The flag format will be uoftctf{URL1_URL2_AMT_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_USERNAME}
